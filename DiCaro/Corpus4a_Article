Depending on the variety, the mango's pulp can be shades of yellow, orange, or even red, adding to its visual appeal.

The year 2008 marked a significant milestone in the history of global finance with the outbreak of the financial crisis that shook economies worldwide. Known as the Global Financial Crisis or the Great Recession, it was a severe economic downturn that originated in the United States but quickly spread to become a global phenomenon.
The crisis was triggered by the collapse of the US housing market and the subprime mortgage crisis. Subprime mortgages were loans granted to borrowers with low creditworthiness. Excessive reliance on these risky mortgages led to a surge in default rates and a subsequent decline in housing prices. Financial institutions, having invested heavily in complex financial products based on these mortgages, faced mounting losses and a crisis of liquidity.
The collapse of the housing market set off a chain reaction that reverberated throughout the global financial system. Banks and financial institutions faced insolvency as the value of their assets plummeted. Interbank lending froze, as institutions became wary of counterparty risks, resulting in a credit crunch. Stock markets experienced significant declines, eroding the wealth of investors and causing a loss of confidence in the financial system.
Governments and central banks worldwide were forced to intervene in an unprecedented manner to stabilize the situation. Bailouts and rescue packages were implemented to prevent the collapse of major financial institutions deemed "too big to fail." Central banks slashed interest rates and engaged in massive monetary easing to provide liquidity and stimulate economic activity.
The impact of the crisis on the real economy was profound. Unemployment soared as businesses struggled to survive and implement cost-cutting measures. Consumer spending and investment plummeted, leading to a sharp contraction in economic growth. Housing markets in many countries suffered significant declines, leaving homeowners with negative equity and further exacerbating the crisis.
The crisis exposed fundamental flaws in the global financial system, highlighting the risks associated with excessive leverage, complex financial products, and inadequate regulatory oversight. It raised questions about the ethics and practices of financial institutions, as well as the need for greater transparency and accountability.
In response to the crisis, governments and regulatory bodies implemented substantial reforms aimed at enhancing financial stability and preventing a similar crisis in the future. Measures included stricter regulation and supervision of financial institutions, the establishment of new oversight agencies, and the implementation of international agreements to promote financial stability and cooperation. The effects of the 2008 financial crisis were long-lasting and far-reaching. It led to a prolonged period of economic recession and slow recovery in many countries. Governments faced challenges in managing public debt and restoring fiscal stability. The crisis also had significant social implications, with rising inequality and a loss of trust in financial institutions and government institutions.
Lessons learned from the crisis prompted a reevaluation of economic and financial theories, leading to a renewed focus on risk management, sustainable growth, and inclusive economic policies. The crisis highlighted the interconnectedness and interdependence of global financial systems, emphasizing the need for international cooperation in addressing economic challenges. In conclusion, the financial crisis of 2008 was a watershed moment in economic history, exposing weaknesses in the global financial system and causing widespread economic turmoil. Its aftermath reshaped financial regulations, sparked debates on economic policies, and prompted a rethinking of the role of governments and financial institutions in ensuring stability and sustainable growth. The lessons learned from the crisis continue to shape economic and financial practices today, with the aim of preventing future crises and fostering a more resilient global economy.
