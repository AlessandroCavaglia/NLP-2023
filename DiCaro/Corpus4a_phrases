The mango is a tropical fruit native to India. It has an oval or elongated shape, with a thin and smooth skin that can vary from green to yellow, red, or purple. The mango pulp is juicy and sweet, with a distinctive tropical flavor. Inside the mango, there is a large, flat, and thin seed that occupies most of the space within the fruit.
Mango is rich in vitamins, minerals, and health-beneficial antioxidants. Its pulp can be of different colors, including yellow, orange, or red, depending on the variety. Mangoes ripen on the tree and are harvested when they are ready for consumption. To open a mango, you can cut around the seed and then separate the two halves.
Afterward, you can make cuts on the pulp of the halves to obtain cubes or slices. Mango can be consumed fresh, but it can also be used in many recipes, such as salads, sauces, juices, smoothies, and desserts. Some of the most common mango varieties are Tommy Atkins, Kent, Alphonso, and Ataulfo. Mango is considered the "king of fruits" in many tropical countries.
It is a highly appreciated summer fruit for its sweet and refreshing taste. Mango contains enzymes that can tenderize meat, so it can also be used as an ingredient for marinating meats or tenderizing tough cuts of meat. Mango is also a good source of dietary fiber, which promotes digestion and bowel regularity.
The 2008 financial crisis was a severe global financial crisis that originated in the United States. The crisis was triggered by the collapse of the US housing market and the subprime mortgage crisis. Subprime mortgages were home loans granted to individuals with poor creditworthiness.
Excessive reliance on these risky mortgages led to an increase in default rates and a decline in housing prices. Banks and financial institutions had heavily invested in financial products based on these mortgages, creating a chain of unsustainable risks and debts.
The collapse of the housing market triggered a crisis in the financial sector, with several institutions suffering heavy losses. Banks found themselves in distress, with many failing or being rescued through government interventions. The crisis quickly spread globally as international financial institutions were deeply interconnected.
Stock markets experienced significant collapses, economies entered into recession, and unemployment rose dramatically. Governments of many countries implemented economic stimulus measures and financial institution bailouts in an attempt to stabilize the economy.
The 2008 crisis highlighted the need for greater regulation and supervision of the financial sector to prevent the recurrence of similar events. The consequences of the crisis were long-lasting, with many countries facing slow economic recovery. Confidence in financial markets was severely damaged, and investors became more cautious.
The crisis raised important issues regarding risk management, transparency, and ethics in the financial sector. Regulatory authorities strengthened rules and requirements to prevent and manage future financial shocks. The 2008 crisis had a significant impact on families, businesses, and economies worldwide, leaving a legacy of instability and uncertainty.
